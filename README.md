pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

3. Configure environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Airtable credentials
```

4. Start Ollama and pull a model:
```bash
ollama pull mistral
```

5. Run the development server:
```bash
uvicorn src.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` for the interactive API documentation.

## Configuration

Key environment variables:

```bash
# LLM Configuration
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=mistral

# Vector Database
CHROMA_PERSIST_DIRECTORY=./chroma_db

# Airtable Integration
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=your_airtable_api_key
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your_base_id
AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME=Leads
```

## API Documentation

The API provides complete endpoints for lead intake, management, and analytics. Visit `/docs` for interactive Swagger documentation.

### Lead Intake Endpoints

#### Submit Single Lead
```bash
POST /api/v1/intake
```
Processes a lead through the complete AI pipeline including duplicate detection, LLM analysis, vector storage, and CRM sync.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/intake" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "My car is making strange noises when I brake",
    "contact": {
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Doe", 
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "phone": "+1234567890"
    },
    "source": "web_form"
  }'
```

#### Batch Lead Processing
```bash
POST /api/v1/intake/batch
```
Process up to 50 leads simultaneously for efficient bulk operations.

#### Check Similar Leads
```bash
POST /api/v1/intake/check-similar
```
Real-time duplicate detection without full processing - perfect for form validation.

### Lead Management Endpoints

#### List Leads
```bash
GET /api/v1/leads?limit=10&status=enriched&intent=appointment_request
```
Paginated listing with filtering by status, intent, urgency, quality score, date range, and text search.

#### Get Lead Details
```bash
GET /api/v1/leads/{lead_id}
```
Complete lead information including AI analysis and processing metadata.

#### Find Similar Leads
```bash
GET /api/v1/leads/{lead_id}/similar?threshold=0.8&limit=5
```
Vector similarity search to find related leads.

#### Update Lead
```bash
PUT /api/v1/leads/{lead_id}
```
Update lead metadata and custom fields.

#### Delete Lead
```bash
DELETE /api/v1/leads/{lead_id}
```
Remove lead from all systems (storage, vector DB, CRM).

### Analytics & Health

```bash
GET /api/v1/leads/stats/summary?days=30    # Lead statistics
GET /api/v1/intake/health                  # Service health check
GET /api/v1/health                        # Application health
```
